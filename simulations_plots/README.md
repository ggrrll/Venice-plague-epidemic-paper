Models are defined and fitted in the [epid\_simulations](../epid_simulations.ipynb) notebook

In this folder there are data from fitting experiments and in particular the plots for fig **4c**,  **SI5e** and **SI6a** from the paper


* `trends_2timesteps_0.48767_0.829039_2.1e-05_N_3600.csv` contains for instance N = 3600  model simulations run on a WS (Watts-Strogatz) graph, while the `trends_ER*.csv` files contain simulations run on a ER (Erdos-Renyi) graph
* `html` files are (similar) version of the same `pdf` plots, but instead interactive ones (realized with [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/))
