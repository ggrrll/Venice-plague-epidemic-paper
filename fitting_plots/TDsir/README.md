Models are defined and fitted in the [models\_of\_plague\_epid](../models_of_plague_epid.ipynb) notebook

In this folder there are in particular the plots for fig **SI5d** and **4b** from the paper

(we keep the old folder structure (`./baseline_applied`), although we abandoned the model fitting without removing the baseline)
